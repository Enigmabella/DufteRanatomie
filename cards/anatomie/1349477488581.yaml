Title: 'Muscles of Sole of Foot: Third Layer'

OccludedImage: '<img src="MSA-Muscles_of_Sole_of_Foot-Third_Layer58.jpg">'
Clinical: '<b>Clinical:</b> A bunion (hallux valgus) often occurs in women who wear shoes that are too narrow. In this deformity, the first metatarsal bone is displaced medially (varus), and the proximal phalanx is partially dislocated and displaced laterally (valgus). The lateral sesamoid bone also is displaced laterally.'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b>  The transverse head of this muscle does not arise from a bone but from plantar ligaments.'
Origin: '<b>Origin (proximal):</b>  The oblique head arises from the bases of the 2nd to 4th metatarsal bones and the long plantar ligament.  The transverse head arises from the plantar metatarsophalangeal ligaments of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th toes.  <br><br>'
Insertion: '<b>Insertion (distal):</b>  The 2 heads of the muscle converge, and their central tendon blends with that of the flexor hallucis brevis and shares the lateral sesamoid bone with that muscle.  The common tendon inserts on the lateral side of the base of the proximal phalanx of the big toe.  <br><br>'
Attachments: ''
Innervation: '<b>Innervation:</b>  Deep branch of lateral plantar nerve (S2 and S3).  <br><br>'
Actions: '<b>Action:</b>  Adducts the big toe and flexes the proximal phalanx at the metatarsophalangeal joint.  Also helps to maintain the transverse metatarsal arch of the foot.  <br><br>'
