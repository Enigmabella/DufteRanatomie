Clinical: '<img src="paste-42498707ff67f442e31f8fb97c8955f917a45e4f.jpg"><br>Inherited collagen disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome involve a defect in the synthesis or assembly of collagen fibrils leading to inadequate strength and hyperextensibile skin and hypermovable joints.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-f96702ae2d4466afc377742c312271cf52141130.jpg"><br>Comment: Fibroblasts are the principal cell type of connective tissue. They are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of the ground substance and the connective tissue fibers in the extracellular matrix (ECM) including collagen, elastic, or reticular fibers. In mature connective tissue, these cells are relatively inactive and immobile, where they are often known as fibrocytes. Following injury and during wound repair, they rapidly proliferate and become active fibroblasts to synthesize new extracellular fibers and ground substance. Fibroblasts are the most common cell of loose (areolar) and virtually the only cell of dense regular connective tissue such as tendon.'
