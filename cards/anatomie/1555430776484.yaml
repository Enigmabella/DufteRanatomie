Clinical: '<img src="paste-ebea1ad4ecb5e2f2cd417b0723ed7f108211cf66.jpg"><br>Hirschsprung disease is a developmental disorder characterized by an absence of ganglion cells of the ENS. It leads to uncoordinated  peristalsis, constipation, and functional obstruction. Surgical removal of the affected region followed by anastamosis of unaffected areas is  the mode of treatment.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-7c04bbc388b3e76dccde292478687599226ec5ce.jpg"><br>Comment: The digestive tract, from the esophagus to the anus, has its own intrinsic nerve supply. Known as the enteric nervous system (ENS), it consists of an extensive network of nerve fibers, nerve cell bodies (ganglion cells), and their supportive (glial) cells. Derived embryonically from the neural crest, the ENS consists of 2 distinct yet connected parts within the wall of the digestive tract. The larger myenteric (Auerbach) plexus is between inner and outer layers of smooth muscle in the muscularis externa. It mainly regulates smooth muscle contraction, peristalsis, and gastrointestinal motility. The smaller submucosal (Meissner) plexus mostly regulates glandular secretion and local blood flow.'
