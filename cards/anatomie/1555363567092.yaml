Clinical: '<img src="paste-0f0b156b10cf8ca577ed917d2880c16b5a0b8833.jpg"><br>Transphenoidal microsurgery is a commonly used technique to remove small pituitary tumors confined to the sella turcica. The sphenoid air sinus lies inferior and anterior to the pituitary, which can be accessed through the nasal cavity and sinuses.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-04cc1be7e3c20b69f72d34d1e52220a6f235b559.jpg"><br>Comment: The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland contains clumps or cords of glandular epithelial cells that secrete hormones into a network of sinusoidal capillaries with large or irregular lumina, all of which is supported by a delicate reticular fiber stroma. Glandular epithelial cells can be classified into chromophils (which are large, possess secretory granules, and stain intensely), and chromophobes (which are smaller and stain faintly). Chromophils are subdivided into acidophils and basophils. In routine stains, the proportion of glandular cell types has been estimated to be about 40% acidophils, 10% basophils, and 50% chromophobes. More precise identification of cell types by immunocytochemistry has made it possible to identify their hormone content.'
