Clinical: '<img src="paste-73348a81d531059c11683512fc3f2a0b713f7956.jpg"><br>In the surgical procedure known as tracheotomy, an incision is made in the trachea through the front of the neck to artificially open the airway. A metal, plastic, or silicone tracheostomy tube is then inserted into the opening to permit normal breathing. Tracheotomies may be performed in emergencies or for long-term mechanical ventilation of critically ill patients.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-ee7ef6f9015e99c50cb103944710c9aa09065a61.jpg"><br>Comment: The trachea is a semirigid tube, 2 to 3. cm in diameter and 15 to 20 cm long, and has an outermost adventitia of connective tissue. About 16 to 20 crescent-shaped hyaline cartilage rings in the tracheal wall ensure patency of the lumen. They also provide rigidity and maintain shape. The lining epithelium is typical respiratory (pseudostratified) epithelium, which rests on a basement membrane. Most cells are ciliated columnar cells, which are interspersed with a few goblet cells. Metaplasia of the epithelium occurs in response to local friction and chronic coughing. The underlying lamina propria is loose, highly cellular connective tissue. Mixed seromucous glands extend into the submucosa.'
