Comment: '<img src="paste-9741a112926c65129debf7746802ae66a824ea96.jpg"><br>Comment: Reticular connective tissue, a specialized loose connective tissue, consists of reticular fibers that form the supportive stroma of many tissues and organs. They are long, thin, extracellular fibers, measuring 100 to 150 nm in diameter. They do not form bundles like collagen fibers but appear as a felt-like aggregation of branching fibers. Once believed to possess a different composition from collagen, they are now known to be thin type III collagen fibers. Like elastic fibers, reticular fibers stain poorly with conventional methods and require special light microscopic stains. Their selective staining with metallic silver visualized by light microscopy is most likely due to precipitation of reducible silver salts on an external coating of bound proteoglycans.'
