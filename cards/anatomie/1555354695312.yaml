Clinical: '<img src="paste-5bfeb02c9b09ff15984091741cdec1c0b2b1d593.jpg"><br>Malignant tumors of glandular epithelial cells are known as adenocarcinomas. Such tumors have glandular (secretory) properties, and include cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, stomach, pancreas, thyroid, and uterine cervix.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-5db3a603e39cbff0f17c54f37b47d0f9af5f94a8.jpg"><br>Comment: Multicellular exocrine glands are classified by the shape and arrangement of their secretory units. They may be tubular, acinar (alveolar), or tubulo-acinar (i.e., mixed). They may be further classified by the structure of their duct system: simple or unbranched, as in sweat glands, and compound or branched, as in most organs such as the pancreas and liver. Glands may be classified by the nature of their secretions. They may be mucous, when the secretion is a viscous glycoprotein known as mucus, serous, when the secretion is watery and enzyme-rich, or mixed seromucous, when the same gland produces both secretions. Glands may also be classified by their mode of secretion. Merocrine secretion—the most common type—involves the release (or exocytosis) of secretory vesicles from the cell by fusion with its plasma membrane. Apocrine secretion, such as in the mammary gland, involves the release of the apical cytoplasm of the cell. Holocrine secretion in the sebaceous glands of the skin involves the disintegration and release of whole cells.'
