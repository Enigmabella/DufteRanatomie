Title: 'Muskeln der R端ckens: Medialer Trakt'

Clinical: '<b>Clinical:</b> Clinicians often refer to the transversospinal muscles simply as the paravertebral muscles because they form a solid mass of muscle tissue interposed between the transverse and spinous processes.<br>'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b>  This plate shows the deepest layer of back muscles, which includes the transversospinal, or paravertebral, muscles.  The transversospinal muscles include the semispinalis, multifidi, and rotatores.  Most of these muscles arise from the transverse processes of adjacent vertebrae.  They pass superiorly to attach to spinous or transverse processes of vertebrae above.  <br><br>The transversospinal muscles are important for stabilizing the vertebrae during movements of the vertebral column, and they can assist in extension and rotary movements of the vertebrae.  <br><br>Clinicians often refer to the transversospinal muscles simply as the paravertebral muscles because they form a solid mass of muscle tissue interposed between the transverse and spinous processes.<br>'
