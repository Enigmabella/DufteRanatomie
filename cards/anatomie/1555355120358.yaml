Clinical: '<img src="paste-bcb78ba4b88afcc0673450c2dc154a5b86c3cf76.jpg"><br>Tendinopathies are commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Tendons can become inflamed, weakened, and “click,” or even rupture.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-e34c674c5e7a963ffe8fe81e63d4c06f5644b89d.jpg"><br>Comment: Connective tissue is the most versatile of the basic tissues and consists of connective tissue proper and specialized forms such as bone, cartilage, and blood. Connective tissue proper includes a range of recognizable histologic types and can be classified as loose or dense connective tissue. Dense connective tissue may have a regular arrangement, as in tendon, or an irregular arrangement, as in the dermis of skin. The main function of the collagen fibers is to impart tensile strength to the tissue.'
