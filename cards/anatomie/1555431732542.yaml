Clinical: '<img src="paste-5ac8cefb416b274c997b575cdd6b7383f01afe38.jpg"><br>Obstruction of the narrow lumen of the appendix may lead to appendicitis—an inflammation that may cause pain in the lower right quadrant. Acute appendicitis, which initially affects the mucosa, may lead to abscess, necrosis, penetration into the peritoneal cavity, and a complication known as peritonitis. Benign and malignant  tumors of the appendix may also occur. The most common are known as carcinoid tumors.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-d7e48d348ee7c7403a13eb2591e4e6d0b6daf1b2.jpg"><br>Comment: The appendix—a slender worm-shaped tube—projects from the blind end of the cecum. It is attached to the mesentery of the terminal ileum by the mesoappendix. Its lumen is wide and patent in early childhood, but may become obliterated with age.  A distinctive feature of the appendicular wall is the presence of large numbers of lymphoid nodules in the mucosa and submucosa. They are part of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which functions in immunologic defense. Germinal centers in these nodules are sites of B-lymphocyte production.'
