Title: 'Perineal Spaces'

OccludedImage: '<img src="MSA-Perineal_Spaces7.jpg">'
Clinical: '<b>Clinical:</b> Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an inability to achieve and/or maintain penile erection sufficient for sexual intercourse. Normally, sexual stimulation releases nitric oxide from nerve endings and vascular endothelial cells, thus relaxing the smooth muscle tone and increasing blood flow, which then compresses the veins draining the erectile tissues and allows for engorgement of the tissues. Available ED drugs aid in the relaxation of the smooth muscle.<br>'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b>  In men, only a portion of the muscle forms a true sphincter of the urethra (external urethral sphincter).  It is thought that another portion of the muscle extends vertically to the bladder and invests the prosthetic urethra anteriorly and laterally.  It is unknown how or whether this muscle acts on the prostatic urethra.  <br><br>At the neck of the male urinary bladder, an internal urethral sphincter (smooth muscle, sympathetically innervated from L1-2) exists that is important during ejaculation because it prevents semen from entering the urinary bladder or urine from entering the prostatic urethra.<br>'
Usernotes: ''
Origin: '<b>Origin:</b>  Arises from the ischiopubic ramus.  <br><br>'
Insertion: '<b>Insertion:</b>  Inserts into a median raphe and the perineal body and extends superoanterior along the prostate to the neck of the urinary bladder.  <br><br>'
Attachments: ''
Innervation: '<b>Innervation:</b>  Perineal branch of the pudendal nerve (S2-4).  <br><br>'
Actions: '<b>Action:</b>  Acting together, muscles on both sides form a sphincter that compresses the membranous portion of the male urethra.  <br><br>'
