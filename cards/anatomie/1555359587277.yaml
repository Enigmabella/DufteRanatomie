Clinical: '<img src="paste-d3feb35c3d2dadff1747ad58c70e0f0da5d0bd87.jpg"><br>Neutropenia is an abnormal decrease in the neutrophil count in peripheral blood, and patients with this condition have an inadequate number of neutrophils to defend against bacterial infections. While neutropenia may be caused by genetic, drug-induced, or other factors, it is often associated with autoimmune diseases and is a common feature of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).'
Comment: '<img src="paste-7e1c33185a94e10ebd8304b33345e604572ff2e8.jpg"><br>Comment: Neutrophils are the most numerous of leukocytes, constituting 60% to 70% of the leukocyte count. They are also known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes due to their distinctive nuclear morphology. They measure 9 to 12 um in diameter, and their nucleus displays many forms, has a clump-like pattern, and consists of 3 to 5 lobes connected by fine strands of chromatin. In females, a small separate lobe shaped like a small drumstick called a Barr Body is often present. It is not seen in males and may be useful in determining the chromosomal sex of a person. Neutrophils are avidly phagocytic—their lifespan may reach 4 days—they engulf bacteria, cellular debris, and foreign matter. Their membrane-bounded specific granules contain bactericidal enzymes engaged in receptor-mediated phagocytosis.'
