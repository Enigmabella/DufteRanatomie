It may cause hepatitis in newborns and often leads to cirrhosis.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-61fe8750beba8942c1415e354aa2c41dd75815f4.jpg"><br>Comment: Hepatocytes are polyhedral parenchymal cells derived from foregut endoderm. They comprise a network of interconnecting plates, 1 or 2 cells thick. Hepatic sinusoids are suspended within spaces between the hepatocytes. Narrow fluid-filled perivascular spaces—the perisinusoidal spaces of Dissé—are interposed between the endothelial lining of the sinusoids and the hepatocyte surfaces. These spaces allow exchange of soluble noncellular substances between blood and parenchyma. Apposing membranes of 2 adjoining hepatocytes form an intercellular channel—the bile canaliculus. Hepatocytes secrete bile into canaliculi. Hepatocyte lateral borders are reinforced with desmosomes and tight junctions that sequester contents of canalicular lumina and prevent bile leakage into the bloodstream.'
