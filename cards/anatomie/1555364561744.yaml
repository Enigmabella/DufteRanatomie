Clinical: '<img src="paste-56c81ccabd108296751a5c915137b8ed2d6e1abc.jpg"><br>Langerhans cells increase in number in various inflammatory conditions, such as contact dermatitis. The rare autoimmune histiocytosis X also involves Langerhans cells. In addition, these cells are depleted in late stages of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) particles are located.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-97612784844113c05cf56e79c94ab6af10014f37.jpg"><br>Comment: Langerhans cells are monocyte-derived dendritic cells found in superficial layers of the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum of the epidermis of skin. They account for 2% to 8% of the total epidermal cell population. They require special stains or electron microscopy to positively identify them. They have a single, highly indented nucleus. Their cytoplasm contains a Golgi complex, lysosomes, and unique inclusions known as Birbeck granules. They are phagocytic and antigen-processing cells of the immune system.'
