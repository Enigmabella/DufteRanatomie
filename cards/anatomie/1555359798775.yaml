It often occurs in infants and adolescents in response to infections that, in adults, would typically produce a neutrophil response. While there are many causes, the most common is a primary infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The condition, otherwise known as infectious mononucleosis, causes a rise in circulating T lymphocytes in response to EBV infection of B cells.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-9ba5a50fa679fd447422c48ead37d2b7c5ae7509.jpg"><br>Comment: Lymphocytes are the most numerous of the agranular leukocytes, constituting 20% to 30% of the leukocyte count. They range in size from 7 to 16 um and are classified into small (7 to  10 um) and medium-to-large (11 to 16 um) lymphocytes. They are spherical cells with a densely stained nucleus and a thin rim of blue- gray cytoplasm. Whereas all lymphocytes are derived from bone marrow stem cells, those that differentiate and mature in the thymus are called T cells; those that develop in the bone marrow, where they acquire specific cell surface antigens, are known as B cells. T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity as opposed to B cells, which are engaged in humoral (antibody) immunity. The lifespan of lymphocytes ranges from days to many years.'
