Clinical: '<img src="paste-7d2eb5d56933d1e24c60fbe0045229f730dcae6b.jpg"><br>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary disorder of the myocardium, often resulting in sudden cardiac death. It is most often a familial disorder (65%), with an autosomal dominant transmission. Abnormal growth and hypertrophy of cardiac muscle cells results in ventricular wall thickening, and the myocardial cells are disarrayed instead of displaying a normal arrangement.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-176b609ca04276c136f8786b40d05209dfd40cad.jpg"><br>Comment: Cardiac muscle is striated, involuntary muscle in the myocardium of the heart wall. Cardiac muscle cells (also known as myocardial cells or cardiomyocytes) contain the same basic organization of myofibrils, myofilaments, and cross-striations as in skeletal muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells are smaller and contain a single centrally placed nucleus, although they may sometimes be binucleated. Cells are joined together by specialized junctions called intercalated discs.'
