Clinical: '<img src="paste-348cfb400255c9311bef342e77785bf53bf96595.jpg"><br>Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges. Most frequently caused by bacteria or viruses, it may also be due to other pathogens, such as fungi or parasites. Bacterial meningitis is less common than the viral form, and can be life threatening. Bacterial meningitis is characterized by exudates of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), whereas viral hepatitis is marked mostly by an infiltration of lymphocytes in the brain and elevated numbers of T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF).'

It is a dense, fibrous, connective tissue consisting of interlacing bundles of collagen and elastic fibers in association with flattened fibroblasts. The arachnoid and pia mater are thinner and more delicate than the dura, and, together, are known as the leptomeninges. The subarachnoid space is filled with cerebrospinal fluid and also contains branches of cerebral arteries and veins.'
