Clinical: '<img src="paste-92366a255156c797e09a4ba4313876443e1b55dd.jpg"><br>Rathke’s cyst (a rudiment of Rathke’s pouch) is an epithelial-lined cyst that may become symptomatic due to enlargement and compression of the pituitary gland or stalk, optic chiasm, or hypothalamus. It is usually benign, ranging in size from 2 to 4cm, and can be removed by microsurgical methods.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-797a78e3965ab919d591cef0fd2bae94fcc052b6.jpg"><br>Comment: At the junction between the anterior and posterior lobe, the contrasting histologic structure is evident at low magnification. The anterior lobe is a glandular epithelium, which appears darkly stained because its nucleated parenchymal cells are numerous and tightly packed. Conversely, the posterior lobe is more lightly stained because it is made of nervous tissue. In the region of the intermediate lobe, rudiments of Rathke’s pouch persist as accumulations of small colloid-filled cysts at the border with the posterior lobe. The intermediate lobe constitutes less than 2% of the pituitary in the adult human. Basophilic cells from the intermediate lobe often invade the pars nervosa. Cells of the intermediate lobe produce melanocyte-stimulating hormone and the opiate peptide, beta-endorphin.'
