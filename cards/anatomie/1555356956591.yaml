Clinical: '<img src="paste-437729df6abc817e74edfbe111e95e4cc8c698d3.jpg"><br>Muscle injury stimulates the activation of satellite cells and leads to several rounds of proliferation, followed by differentiation and fusion either to form new muscle fibers or to repair damaged ones.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-672880aed50f79371c0c6fe56aeb420092c936c3.jpg"><br>Comment: Satellite cells are small, flattened, mononucleated cells located between the sarcolemma of a skeletal muscle fiber and the external lamina. Their euchromatic nucleus is typical of active, protein-synthesizing cells. The cytoplasm of the satellite cell contains scattered free ribosomes and a few profiles of rough and smooth- surfaced endoplasmic reticulum. A narrow gap separates it from the muscle fiber where the plasma membranes of the 2 cells are parallel to each other, making them identifiable by electron microscopy or by immunocytochemical staining and molecular markers. The underlying muscle fiber contains tightly packed myofibrils and a few mitochondria. Both the satellite cell and the muscle fiber share the same external lamina.'
