Clinical: '<img src="paste-ec7b1e85f9d1f91307f148a65f5f15b5ed62c9f2.jpg"><br>A complete blood count (CBC) is a valuable screening test that measures the number of erythrocytes, number of leukocytes, total amount of hemoglobin in blood, and fraction of erythrocytes, known as the hematocrit. It also includes other information about the erythrocytes such as mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Also included in the CBC is the platelet count. The CBC is used to diagnose and manage many conditions and diseases such as acute and chronic forms of infection, allergies, and various types of anemias.'

Erythrocytes (or red blood cells), granular (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) and agranular leukocytes (monocytes, lymphocytes), and circulating cytoplasmic fragments known as platelets (or thrombocytes) make up the cellular elements.'
