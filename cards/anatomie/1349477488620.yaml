Clinical: ''
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> <b>Growth hormone (GH)</b> promotes the synthesis of insulin-like growth factors; has growth-promoting and anabolic effects.<br> <b>Prolactin</b> stimulates production of breast milk.<br> <b>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</b> stimulates thyroid hormone production by the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones affect virtually all systems and generally act to increase metabolism and growth processes.<br> <b>Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)</b> stimulates synthesis of adrenocortical steroids. In the adrenal cortex, ACTH stimulates cortisol synthesis; ACTH also can stimulate adrenal androgen synthesis and has permissive effects on aldosterone production.<br> <b>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)</b> promotes development of primordial ovarian follicles in the first half of the menstrual cycle. In the male, FSH promotes spermatogenesis, in conjunction with testosterone.<br> <b>Luteinizing hormone (LH)</b> promotes ovulation during the ovulatory phase of menstruation. In the male, LH stimulates Leydig cell testosterone synthesis.<br> <b>Oxytocin</b> stimulates milk let-down and uterine contraction.<br> <b>Vasopressin</b> acts on the renal collecting ducts to open water channels (aquaporins), increasing solute-free water reabsorption. These effects help conserve fluid and maintain blood pressure during dehydration or volume loss. It is also a potent vasoconstrictor.'
