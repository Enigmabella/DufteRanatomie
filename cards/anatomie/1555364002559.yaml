Clinical: '<img src="paste-1f36b765238b7cd93955486d4dd047f8bd45eafe.jpg"><br>Type I, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is caused by an autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the islets. In early stages, the islets are infiltrated with lymphocytes and, later, islets fail to produce insulin and show fibrosis and accumulation of amyloid. In type Il, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, islets usually appear normal but produce inadequate amounts of insulin and there is an abnormality in target cell receptors to insulin.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-f19b1f5fc93d0995de7186e6cae85c4ea79d1d97.jpg"><br>Comment: Although the pancreas is a major exocrine gland of the digestive tract, it also has an important endocrine portion consisting of the islets of Langerhans. Islets are ~300 um or less in diameter. Developmentally, they arise from the ends of the endodermally derived ducts and become scattered throughout the entire pancreas. Totaling ~1 million in the normal adult, they are twice as numerous in the tail of the gland as in other parts. The hormone-secreting (parenchymal) cells in the islet are closely packed, richly vascularized polygonal cells arranged in cordlike clusters. The two main islet cell types are alpha cells, which produce glucagon, and beta cells, which synthesize insulin.'
