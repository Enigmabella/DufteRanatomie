Although it is relatively rare in developed countries, chronic infection with the hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus increases the risk of developing this cancer. While definitive diagnosis is made by core or fine-needle biopsy, blood alpha-fetoprotein is a useful diagnostic marker. Staging of this carcinoma helps predict prognosis and aids in choice of therapy. If the tumor is small, surgery and liver transplantation are potentially  curative.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-76432aae398908540b4cf4188ee9406cac6eeba6.jpg"><br>Comment: Hepatic lobules look like a mosaic of interlocking tiles within the substance of the liver. Each classic hepatic lobule takes the form of a prism and is about 1 mm in diameter and 2 mm long. The corners of each lobule contain portal triads surrounded by small amounts of connective tissue. In cross section, each lobule consists of plates of hepatocytes, 1 or 2 cells thick. Hepatocytes are separated by hepatic sinusoids and appear to radiate out from a small central vein. Hepatocyte arrangement resembles that of a sponge, with sinusoids represented by the spaces.'
