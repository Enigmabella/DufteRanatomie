Clinical: '<img src="paste-8c2d18090bcde35bdcdbfbd07b5f8b76f7c1b3e9.jpg"><br>Coronary arteries are frequently involved in atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, which can lead to ischemia and myocardial infarction. Elevated circulating levels of low-density lipoproteins cause damage to arterial endothelium, which leads to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Cholesterol laden foam cells are a characteristic feature of plaquesâ€”these cells are transformed macrophages and smooth muscle cells.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-89aaf488e34adb25823a5e43d193ae27b73a2354.jpg"><br>Comment: Coronary arteries supply oxygenated blood to the cardiac muscle in the myocardium of the heart. From their epicardial location, coronary arteries give rise to arterioles, which supply blood to an extensive network of capillaries in the myocardium. Compared to other muscular arteries, coronary arteries have an extremely thick tunica adventitia rich in collagen, adipose tissue, and elastic fibers. Smooth muscle cells in the media are richly innervated by sympathetic nerves.'
