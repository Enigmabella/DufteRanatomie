Clinical: '<img src="paste-43f01e42b5f058af50eca0bb86182c1c4befd96e.jpg"><br>Acne vulgaris—a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit—is common during adolescence and results in increased sebum production and distention of the hair follicle. Acne affects both sexes, but males tend to have more severe disease. Systemic antibiotics and temporary use of topical steroids are treatments.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-81c14e0672a37e612314fc3aac4485b6cbdfec94.jpg"><br>Comment: The pilosebaceous unit consists of the hair, hair follicle, and an arrector pili muscle accompanied by a sebaceous gland. The long axis of the hair follicle is situated obliquely to the plane of the epidermal surface. Except for lips, palms, soles, and a few other sites, hairs cover most of the body surface. Hair growth occurs in cycles and consists of anagen, catagen, and telogen phases. Contraction of the arrector pili muscle erects the hair and depresses the adjacent skin, resulting in “goose flesh.”'
