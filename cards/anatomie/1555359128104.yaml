Clinical: '<img src="paste-f677a0cbb9f78539625d15aa42dd47c19b68191c.jpg"><br>Osteomalacia is a metabolic disorder of bone caused by vitamin D deficiency. It is known as rickets in children and is characterized by excessive amounts of unmineralized osteoid, where bone mineral fails to be deposited in normally formed bone matrix. While osteoid comprises less than 5% of normal bone, it can account for 40% to 50% of bone in osteomalacia and rickets. Consequently, bone strength is reduced, resulting in fractures and bone pain.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-81fbcbb635eb2376d21386b28ca6f542e89f71cb.jpg"><br>Comment: Depending on the orientation of collagen fibers in the bony matrix, bone tissue is organized as either primary (woven) or mature (lamellar) bone. Woven bone is present in bones of fetuses and young children and is characterized by coarse collagen fibers that are oriented randomly. Lamellar bone begins to form shortly after birth and actively replaces woven bone by age 4. Trabecula in mature bone is made up of lamellar bone and is intensely eosinophilic. Embedded in the matrix are osteocytes and their lacunae, which are small and spindle shaped.'
