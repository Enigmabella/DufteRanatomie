Clinical: '<img src="paste-7c5c9e8fd674b2f1e0bfb36b6c3e88f7401f9bcd.jpg"><br>Cholelithiasis is the presence of stones in the gallbladder or extrahepatic biliary ducts. Gallstones may also cause gallbladder inflammation known as cholecystitis, characterized by mucosal inflammation with abnormal thickening of the muscularis layer. Laparoscopic surgery is the most common treatment for gallstones.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-b4b3266a0d3a5b22538d8b05cf01332f2c7cdc59.jpg"><br>Comment: The gallbladder lumen is lined by simple columnar epithelial cells with many microvilli on their apical surface. Each cell has a single spherical nucleus, usually situated toward the base of the cell. Basal infoldings of the plasma membrane and lateral interdigitations of adjacent cell membranes reflect the role of these cells in ion transport. The epithelium rests on a delicate basement membrane that separates it from underlying lamina propria. The gallbladder stores bile, which is released by reflex contraction of smooth muscle cells in the underlying muscularis in response to the hormone cholecystokinin.'
