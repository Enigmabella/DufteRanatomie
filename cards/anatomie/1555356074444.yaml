Clinical: '<img src="paste-42a7910774800bee6d6b9a606f60da6432b510a1.jpg"><br>Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction. It occurs when IgE antibodies bind with allergens and cause mast cells to release histamine and other molecules stored in these cells.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-6c066ca580f8f08637d2588eb56d1bc37f95bead.jpg"><br>Comment: Mast cells are normal elements of the connective tissues and lamina propria of mucous membranes, where they trigger or maintain inflammatory and immune responses. They are found at sites of inflammation and neoplastic foci and play a central role in immediate allergic reactions. Mast cells are able to release potent inflammatory mediators such as histamine, heparin, chemotaxic factors, cytokines, and metabolites of arachidonic acid that act on the vasculature, smooth muscle, connective tissue, mucous glands, and inflammatory cells. Histamine is a vasodilator and proteolytic enzyme that can destroy tissue or cleave complement components. Heparin is an anticoagulant. Chemotaxic factors are important regulators of eosinophil and neutrophil function.'
