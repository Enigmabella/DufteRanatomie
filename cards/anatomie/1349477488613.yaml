Title: 'Pelvic Diaphragm: Male 2'

OccludedImage: '<img src="MSA-Pelvic_Diaphragm-Male_22.jpg">'
Clinical: '<b>Clinical:</b> Assisting the levator ani, the coccygeus pulls the coccyx forward after defecation and forms the posterior portion of the pelvic diaphragm.<br>'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b>  The pelvic diaphragm comprises the coccygeus and levator ani.  Together, these muscles support and raise the pelvic floor.  <br><br>The coccygeus muscle is the muscle used by dogs to tuck their tails between their hind legs; in humans, it is largely a mixture of skeletal muscle fibers and fibrous connective tissue.  <br><br>The greater sciatic foramen exists superior to the pelvic diaphragm and provides a passageway for structures to leave the pelvic cavity and enter the gluteal region.  The lesser sciatic foramen exists inferior to the pelvic diaphragm and provides a passageway for neurovascular structures to pass from the gluteal region to the perineum (importantly, the pudendal neurovascular bundle).<br>'
Origin: '<b>Origin:</b>  Arises from the spine of the ischium and the sacrospinous ligament.  <br><br>'
Insertion: '<b>Insertion:</b>  Attaches to the coccyx and lower portion of the sacrum.  <br><br>'
Attachments: ''
Innervation: '<b>Innervation:</b>  Ventral rami of S4 and S5.  <br><br>'
Actions: '<b>Action:</b>  With the levator ani, the coccygeus supports the pelvic floor.  It also draws the coccyx forward after the latter has been pushed back during parturition or defecation.  <br><br>'
