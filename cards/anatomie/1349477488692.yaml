Clinical: '<b>Clinical:</b>   An accentuated lateral and rotational curvature of thoracic or lumbar spine is called scoliosis. An accentuated flexion of the thoracic spine is kyphosis (hunchback), and an accentuated extension of the lumbar spine is lordosis (swayback).<br>'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b>  Typically, the vertebral column comprises 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral (fused), and 4 coccygeal (last 3 fused) vertebrae.  <br><br>Primary curvatures of the vertebral column include the thoracic curvature and sacral curvature.  Secondary curvatures include the cervical curvature and lumbar curvature.  Secondary curvatures develop during infancy as children begin to bear the weight of the head, sit up, stand, and support their own weight.  <br><br>The cervical and lumbar spine allow for greater movement than the other regions of the vertebral column.  <br><br>Note from the illustration that intervertebral discs separate individual bodies of the adjacent vertebrae (except between the first 2 cervical vertebrae, atlas and axis, and the fused sacrum and coccyx).<br>'
