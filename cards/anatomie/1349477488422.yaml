Title: 'Fetal Circulation'

OccludedImage: '<img src="MSA-Fetal_Circulation23.jpg">'
Clinical: ''
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> <b>Ductus arteriosus.</b> In the fetus, blood flows from the pulmonary artery to the aorta through this structure. With inflation of the lungs and reduced pulmonary artery pressure, and with increased systemic arterial pressure due to closing of the umbilical circulation, flow through the ductus is reversed. With higher oxygen tension in arterial blood, vasodilator prostaglandins formed in the ductus fall, resulting in vasoconstriction and closure of the ductus.<br> <b>Foramen ovale.</b> In the fetus, right atrial pressure exceeds left atrial pressure, keeping the foramen open. With inflation of the lung after birth and, therefore, greater flow of blood to the left atrium from the pulmonary circulation, this pressure gradient is reversed, functionally closing the foramen as the tissue flap covers the opening.<br> <b>Ductus venosus.</b> This structure shunts a fraction of the blood from the umbilical vein directly to the inferior vena cava, by passing the liver. It closes after the return of blood from the placental circulation falls, although the mechanism is not well-understood.<br> <b>Umbilical vein.</b> Closure of this vessel occurs after umbilical artery closure, and is probably caused by catecholamines and other factors.<br> <b>Umbilical arteries.</b> The paired umbilical arteries close in response to vasoconstrictor catecholamines, cold and other factors associated with delivery of the baby and placenta.'
