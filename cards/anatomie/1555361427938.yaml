Clinical: '<img src="paste-0b3adc860030dd9fc9417169b9d9d05f50511c00.jpg"><br>Varicose veins are abnormally dilated and tortuous veins that occur when the valves become weakened and incompetent. Those most commonly affected are the superficial veins of the upper and lower parts of the legs. Varicose veins may also develop in the esophagus as a result of cirrhosis of the liver or in the hemorrhoidal venous plexus at the recto-anal junction.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-7ab957bbf625c1034134cde3cef5a562e1a74df1.jpg"><br>Comment: Valves are a characteristic feature of small and medium-sized veins, particularly those in the lower extremity. They prevent the backflow of blood on its return to the heart against the force of gravity. They are local infoldings of the tunica intima that form semilunar folds that project into the lumen in the direction of blood flow. Valves are usually arranged in pairs, or bicuspid leaflets, and are commonly found just distal to where minor venous tributaries join to form larger veins. Each leaflet is covered externally by a thin endothelium that is continuous with the lining of the vessel and is reinforced internally by a thin core of connective tissue consisting of a mixture of collagen and elastic fibers.'
