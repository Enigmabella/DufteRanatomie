Congenital heart defects, ranging from minor to severe, are the most common anomalies at birth. They include septal and valve defects, or transposition of the great vessels.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-3044eddb174988841a9032eadb02ed449810da36.jpg"><br>Comment: The heart is a 4-chambered muscular pump that distributes blood through a series of closed vessels in the body.  It has 2 atria and 2 ventricles, which contain 3 basic tunics in their wallsâ€”the innermost endocardium, middlemost myocardium,  and outermost epicardium. The endocardium consists of a lining endothelium and an underlying layer of connective tissue.  The myocardium forms the bulk of the heart wall and is composed of cardiac muscle. The myocardium is much thicker in the ventricles than in the atria, which reflects differences in the workload of the heart chambers. The epicardium consists of loose fatty connective tissue covered externally by a mesothelium.'
