Title: 'Smooth Muscle'

Clinical: '<img src="paste-ae19b9f525f13c5c8d42a5d55b065e7222e58f1a.jpg"><br>Asthma and hypertension are commonly due to redundant contraction of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, respectively. Smooth muscle cells surrounding these passages can undergo  hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy that contribute to the lumen obstruction.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-d6fd9bef231a569095a51bed1ec938fd591df7b6.jpg"><br>Comment: Smooth muscle has a much slower and more variable speed of contraction, which can be sustained for long periods. It lacks visible striations but can produce contractile force comparable to that of skeletal muscle. Myosin- and actin-containing filaments predominate in the sarcoplasm along with a network of intermediate filaments including desmin or vimentin. Dense bodies are unique to smooth muscle and are found throughout the cytoplasm or attached to the undersurface of the sarcolemma where they link thin and intermediate filaments to the cell membrane. The attachment of thin filaments to dense bodies and their content of the protein, alpha- actinin, is reminiscent of that found at Z bands of skeletal muscle.'
