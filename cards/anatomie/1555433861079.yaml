Clinical: '<img src="paste-9c5971792d0763316fbcfc0f5ec798ec68b6d5e0.jpg"><br>Of all malignancies of the digestive tract, pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the second leading cause of death from cancer. Tumors arise from pancreatic ducts or acinar cells and have a tendency to spread rapidly. Signs and symptoms usually appear when the disease is already well advanced. High-protein and high-fat diets, cigarette smoking, and exposure to industrial carcinogens are thought to be causative factors.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-7875a0ce8ecca1e761194b2aaae62e8dcb75e92d.jpg"><br>Comment: The parenchyma of the pancreas develops embryonically from foregut endoderm. In the adult, it is an accessory digestive gland, 18 cm to 20 cm long and about 100 g in weight. It has a head, neck, body, and tail. It is covered by a thin connective tissue capsule, which sends inward septae that subdivide the gland into indistinct lobules. The pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine parts; the exocrine part is about 99% of the gland by weight. Secretory acini and their associated ducts constitute the parenchyma of the exocrine pancreas. Two cell types—acinar and centroacinar cells—with different functions comprise each acinus.'
