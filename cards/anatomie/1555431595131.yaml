Clinical: '<img src="paste-2499fe23080af897e641de7fbf37d4da97de3e0c.jpg"><br>Colonoscopy—used by gastroenterologists to screen for colon cancer—enables the entire colon and terminal ileum to be evaluated at one examination. Polyps may be removed by therapeutic colonoscopy. They are abnormal elevations of colonic mucosa, which may progress from adenomas to carcinomas.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-9972016b2af6341784d7d1206f828c6fc59ad7fd.jpg"><br>Comment: Goblet cells produce mucus that covers the mucosa of the small and large intestine. Their number increases progressively from proximal duodenum to distal colon. In hematoxylin and eosin sections, they are flask-shaped cells with washed out cytoplasm and a basally located nucleus. Mucus is a highly viscous lubricant that also has antibacterial properties. Goblet cells synthesize, store, and discharge mucus by compound exocytosis. Large secretory vesicles (or mucin granules), which are derived from the Golgi complex, fill the apical cytoplasm prior to discharge of secretory product onto the luminal surface.'
