Most tumors of the respiratory system are carcinomas arising from respiratory epithelium of the tracheobronchial tree or pneumocytes of pulmonary alveoli. Non-small cell carcinomas—the most common—grow rapidly and usually metastasize. They respond poorly to chemotherapy or radiation. Slow-growing carcinoid tumors are neuroendocrine neoplasms from pleuripotential basal cells of respiratory epithelium.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-5f86eed465765db925f1c27e68cb3fdc26b7f491.jpg"><br>Comment: Although bronchi have a smaller diameter compared with the trachea, they closely resemble the trachea histologically and both conduct and condition the air on its way to the lungs. Bronchial walls are held open by hyaline cartilage, which prevents luminal collapse. Bronchial epithelium is pseudostratified and consists mostly of ciliated, goblet, and basal cells. The lamina propria, a loose connective tissue, is separated from the epithelium by a basement membrane. Smooth muscle, situated between the epithelium and cartilage, is under autonomic control. Submucosal glands underneath the smooth muscle release secretory products directly onto the epithelial surface.'
