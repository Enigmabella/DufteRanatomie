Clinical: '<img src="paste-45d0bb2b913232b3bf4806541bbfa3f3c6c15002.jpg"><br>Cilia may be damaged by heavy cigarette smoking, which may lead to chronic respiratory infections. Immotile cilia (Kartagener) syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by deficient dynein side arms of ciliary microtubules. It often leads to sinusitis and bronchiectasis (chronic enlargement of bronchial airways).'
Comment: '<img src="paste-28428c2895b1072cf9764e7da54c8f79dfcd684a.jpg"><br>Comment: Cilia are luminal surface projections of the cells that extend from the nasal cavity to respiratory bronchioles. One cell may bear several hundred. Their major role is to move mucus and entrapped particulate matter, including dust and dead cells, over the cell surfaces toward the oral cavity, where they are eliminated or swallowed. They are 0.25 um in diameter and vary in length from  5 um to 10 um and are anchored to a basal body. They contain a  “Q + 2” arrangement of microtubules and beat rhythmically to move mucus and entrapped material over the cell surface. The beating of cilia, at 10 to 25 beats per second, resembles a breaststroke in swimming with a power and a recovery component.'
