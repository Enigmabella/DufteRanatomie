Title: 'Omentum majus und Abdomen'

OccludedImage: '<img src="MSA-Greater_Omentum_and_Abdominal_Viscera20.jpg">'
Clinical: '<b>Clinical:</b> If a portion of the peritoneal cavity or its contents becomes inflamed, the greater omentum can migrate to the site of inflammation and wall off the site by forming an adhesion, potentially protecting the remainder of the cavity. Because of its ability to wall off an infection site, the greater omentum is sometimes referred to as the abdomen''s policeman.<br>Also, the greater omentum often is a site for the metastatic spread of cancer from multiple primary sites. <br>'
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b>  The abdominopelvic cavity is a potential space.  Parietal peritoneum lines the inner aspect of the abdominal walls and reflects onto the viscera as visceral peritoneum.  <br><br>Portions of the ascending, transverse, and descending colon can be seen framing the small bowel, which consists of the jejunum and ileum in this illustration.  The fatty greater omentum is turned up, but remains attached to the bowel margin.  <br><br>If a portion of the peritoneal cavity or its contents becomes inflamed, the greater omentum can migrate to the site of inflammation and wall off the site by forming an adhesion, potentially protecting the remainder of the cavity.  The greater omentum often is a site for the metastatic spread of cancer from multiple primary sites.<br>'
