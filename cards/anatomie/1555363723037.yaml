Clinical: '<img src="paste-d6e557193f3a789b27a1c7ba3703716616e7259a.jpg"><br>Goiter, a nonspecific term for chronic enlargement of the thyroid, may occur in various diseases of this organ. Hyperthyroidism results in many thyroid diseases, the most common being exophthalmic goiter (or Gravesâ€™ disease). This is an autoimmune disorder caused  by antibodies to the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor on follicular cells.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-ba7e264208ba9e97435aa1c35baa52f2e4f95250.jpg"><br>Comment: The thyroid lies in the lower part of the front of the neck in contact with the upper part of the trachea. It consists of 2 lobes and a connecting isthmus, with the right lobe often twice as large as the left. Each is the size of a flattened chestnut. The glandular parenchyma contains spherical follicles of varying size (50 to 500 um in diameter). Their total number may exceed 20 million. The lumen of each follicle is filled with a thyroglobulin-containing gelatinous colloid. Follicles are lined by a simple cuboidal epithelium that varies in height with functional activity. Small numbers of larger and paler parafollicular (C) cells are situated between the basement membrane of the follicles and the follicular cells, and lie singly or in small groups among the follicular cells. They can also be present in an interfollicular position.'
