Clinical: '<img src="paste-34b68aa64bda8ca25af88a76e41a968d3f5e7169.jpg"><br>Drug-induced liver injury is a significant clinical problem because it often leads to liver failure, which may be life threatening. Knowledge of the zonation of the liver acinus is important in diagnosis of drug- induced liver injury. Overuse of acetaminophen — one of the most widely used analgesic medications worldwide — may cause profound liver toxicity. Manifestations of acetaminophen poisoning include abnormal elevation of liver enzymes and inflammatory damage to hepatic parenchyma. Biopsies of such cases show hepatocellular necrosis in zone 3 — the outermost peripheral zone of the liver acinus.'

Although harder to visualize than the classic hepatic lobule, it is important functionally because it best describes metabolic changes that occur in relation to many diseases. The short axis is defined by distributing branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery that run along the border of 2 classic hepatic lobules. The long axis is a line drawn between the 2 central veins closest to the short axis. In contrast to the classic hepatic lobule, which has at its center the venous drainage (central vein), the liver acinus has at its center the portal and hepatic blood supply to liver parenchyma.'
