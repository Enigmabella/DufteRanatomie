Clinical: '<img src="paste-13514bb946751f69f48b8e0341b9660ebcf18d2d.jpg"><br>Pernicious anemia is a chronic disease caused by impaired vitamin B,2 absorption. It is usually due to failure of parietal cells to produce intrinsic factor. Antibodies to parietal cells occur in 90% of patients. Lack of vitamin B;2 causes neurologic deficits as well as megaloblastic anemia, whereby erythrocyte formation in the bone marrow is abnormal. Treatment is by oral intake or intramuscular injection of supplementary vitamin B;2 (cyalocobalamin).'
Comment: '<img src="paste-77fc3e7e642cc9467a38b844fa2ea3cc5e8aa548.jpg"><br>Comment: Parietal cells—the most numerous cell type in the body of gastric glands—produce hydrochloric acid and vitamin B,» intrinsic factor. They are large, rounded, or pyramidal shaped cells with a single, central nucleus. In hematoxylin and eosin sections they are either washed out (due to preparation artifact) or have a deeply eosinophilic cytoplasm (due to high concentrations of mitochondria). By electron microscopy they contain an extensive canalicular system (infoldings of the apical plasma membrane) lined by microvilli, a small, basal Golgi complex, and rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).'
