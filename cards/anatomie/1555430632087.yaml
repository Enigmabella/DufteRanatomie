Clinical: '<img src="paste-dc38d0695f75154289755bd06c1ae5a3421f7f2c.jpg"><br>Abnormally dilated submucosal veins—known as esophageal varices—may occur in the lower third of the esophagus. They are often associated with cirrhosis of the liver and portal hypertension.  The varices are susceptible to rupture and hemorrhage, which may be life threatening.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-d1c0500ea0dc5d2f5263fa832e642ccd76d560be.jpg"><br>Comment: The muscularis externa of the esophagus, 0.5 to 2mm thick, is made of inner circular and outer longitudinal layers of muscle. In the upper third of the esophagus, both layers contain only skeletal muscle fibers on which nerve fibers of cranial nerves IX and X end as motor endplates. These muscle fibers are unique, however, because their contraction is involuntary. In the middle third of the esophagus, smooth muscle cells are internal to skeletal muscle, and their number gradually increases distally.'
