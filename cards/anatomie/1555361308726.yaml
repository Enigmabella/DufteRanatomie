Clinical: '<img src="paste-056548054309abdf2a41a6a31757799503477040.jpg"><br>A thrombus, or blood clot, can either reduce or completely block the flow of blood through a blood vessel. Atherosclerotic plaques  in the tunica intima of the blood vessel can trigger the development of thrombi.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-bf746f432064fb3b104a7a66ef1465bc85c7928d.jpg"><br>Comment: Arterioles are resistance vessels and are able to undergo vasoconstriction or vasodilatation in response to a variety of neural and non-neural stimuli. They mainly control systemic blood pressure by the action of the smooth muscle in the media. The tunica intima is similar to that of other blood vessels and consists of flattened endothelial cells resting on a thin basal lamina. Vascular smooth muscle cells are found in all blood vessels except capillaries. They perform 2 basic functions in vessel walls. When they contract, they regulate the caliber of the lumen, causing vasoconstriction. Smooth muscle cells also produce the elastic tissue in arterial walls as well as other connective tissue components of the extracellular matrix, such as collagen fibers and ground substance.'
