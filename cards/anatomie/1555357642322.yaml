Clinical: '<img src="paste-55bf3df3636e2280bd56122e33c13b5708776eca.jpg"><br>Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease that affects nerve cells and causes atrophy of the caudate nuclei and putamen. Enlargement of the fluid-filled ventricles of the brain is also a common finding in this disease. Clinical symptoms include spasmodic movements, speech difficulties, and psychologic disorders.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-979dd932826f4f6adf1649a4d4170c90afad11d1.jpg"><br>Comment: The cerebellum is a bilaterally symmetric part of the brain. Its surface is extensively folded and possesses thin, transverse folds known as folia, which resemble the leaves of a tree. It consists of a surface layer of cortex of gray matter and a medullary center of white matter. The outer cortex has a remarkably uniform trilaminar organization and consists of an outer molecular layer, an inner granular layer, and a middlemost monolayer of large, pear-shaped neurons known as Purkinje cells. The molecular layer is a pale- stained zone with relatively few nerve cell bodies. It contains a network of profusely branching dendrites of Purkinje cells and represents mainly a synaptic field.'
