Typical manifestations occur in dentin of teeth, osteoid of bone, connective tissues, and the tunica adventitia of blood vessel walls. Vitamin C is an essential cofactor for hydroxylation of proline to hydroxyproline. Nonhydroxy- lated collagen fibrils are unstable, fail to form a triple helix, and have low tensile strength.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-4066f07f71a1c85928ceffe5e3b575e841f9f63c.jpg"><br>Comment: At 30% to 35% of the bodyâ€™s dry weight, collagen is the most abundant, ubiquitous structural protein. At least 20 genetically distinct types of collagen exist that differ mainly in amino acid composition. Type | collagen, the most common type, and found in dermis, exhibits a distinct axial periodicity when its fibrils are sectioned in the longitudinal plane. The repeating dark and light segments every 67 nm along the length of each fibril are due to the staggered arrangement of their constituent tropocollagen molecules. The cytoplasm of the adjacent fibroblast contains multiple and closely packed RER cisternae.'
