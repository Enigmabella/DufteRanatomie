Title: 'Fibrocartilage'

OccludedImage: '<img src="MSA-Fibrocartilage8.jpg">'
Clinical: ''
Comment: '<b>Comment:</b> Fibrocartilage is found in the annulus 횧brosis of intervertebral discs, symphysis pubis, menisci of synovial joints, and at points of attachment of tendons to bone. It is a mixture between dense regular connective tissue, similar in many respects to tendon or ligament, and hyaline cartilage. Functionally, it combines the tensile strength, 횧rmness, and durability of tendon and the resistance to compression of cartilage. In contrast to the other two types of cartilage, 횧brocartilage is devoid of a distinct perichondrium, blending imperceptibly with surrounding connective tissue or hyaline cartilage. Its matrix is intensely eosinophilic due to the presence of numerous collagen fibers<br> A <b>herniated (slipped) disc</b> is a common condition that affects the intervertebral disc and can cause severe pain or numbness if the protruding disc impinges on a nerve or the spinal cord. It results from an overall loss of elasticity of the disc and subsequent rupture of the annulus fibrobis, which allows the protrusion of the nucleus pulposis through the annulus 횧brosis into the surrounding area of the spinal column.'
