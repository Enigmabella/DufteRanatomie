Clinical: '<img src="paste-e91adceab8c8d2f37b55e2b98dca8ef49ad3bd85.jpg"><br>Obesity is an increase in adipose tissue beyond the normal requirements of the body. It has a multifactorial etiology, and there is a global epidemic of this condition. Excess calories are stored as triglycerides in adipocytes.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-72c57e06fe659b6345a86518183a60a271e066aa.jpg"><br>Comment: Adipose tissue is a specialized loose connective tissue that contains large numbers of adipocytes. Adipocytes are specialized for the synthesis, storage, and mobilization of neutral fats known as triglycerides. Lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme produced by the adipocyte, releases fatty acids and monoglycerides from chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) that are then transported into the adipocyte cytoplasm. Re-esterification into triglycerides occurs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the adipocyte, followed by their storage in the lipid droplet. Hormones, such as insulin, and the sympathetic nervous system, which innervates adipose tissue, control these activities.'
