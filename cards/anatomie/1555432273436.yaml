Clinical: '<img src="paste-ad6e68ddd21ea08697e6b295d31859b14d0fe34f.jpg"><br>Excessive alcohol consumption is toxic to the liver. Hepatocytes in the alcoholic liver accumulate large amounts of fat and show other morphologic changes, such as enlarged mitochondria, and distended smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Inclusions known as Mallory bodies may be scattered in damaged hepatocytes.'
Comment: '<img src="paste-ad558c3a0072810ba64a050d076a6254bd2172d6.jpg"><br>Comment: Hepatocytes usually have a single, centrally placed, spherical nucleus, but binucleated cells and polyploid nuclei are common. One or more prominent nucleoli are often present. The hepatocyte has 3 functional surfaces: a canalicular (secretory) surface, a sinusoidal (absorptive) surface, and a surface between 2 closely apposed cells. The hepatocyte cytoplasm is densely packed with many organelles and inclusions. Mitochondria that provide energy as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are abundant. Free ribosomes, multiple stacks of rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and many Golgi complexes are also in the cytoplasm. Variable numbers of glycogen deposits, lysosomes, lipid droplets, and peroxisomes are also present.'
